<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
<p>
    The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that <br> are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we <br> act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic <br> and tedious; without the details, the asprations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the <br> aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.
